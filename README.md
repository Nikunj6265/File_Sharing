****************************Operation User***************************
The superuser is an Operation User that can only add files using the Django admin panel.


Superuser: username - EZbackend.
           password - EZ@123.


*****************************Test Cases*****************************
While logging in: if the user is not found or the password is incorrect.
                  if the user profile is not verified or if there's an issue with the login process.

While SignUp: if the provided username or email is already taken. 

No other users can add files in the database only the superuser(operation) user can add files in a correct format.



*****************************Deploying a Django project to a production environment.*******************************

1. Choose a Hosting Provider:
Select a hosting provider that supports Django applications. Popular choices include AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean, and Google Cloud Platform.

2. Set Up a Production Database:
Configure the database settings in your Django project's settings.py file.

3. Secure Django Settings:
Update Django settings for production:

Set DEBUG = False.
Configure ALLOWED_HOSTS.
Use a strong SECRET_KEY.
Set up secure storage for sensitive information using environment variables.

4. Collect Static Files:
Configure Django to collect static files in a central location. This is necessary for serving static files in production. Use the collectstatic management command.

python manage.py collectstatic

5. Configure WSGI Server:
Choose a WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI to serve our Django application. Install the chosen server and configure it. For example, if using Gunicorn:
pip install gunicorn
Create a Gunicorn configuration file (e.g., gunicorn_config.py) and run Gunicorn:

gunicorn -c gunicorn_config.py your_project.wsgi:application

7. Set Up a Reverse Proxy:
Use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache to forward requests to the Gunicorn server. Configure the reverse proxy to handle static files and serve as a gateway to the Django application.

8. Use HTTPS:
Obtain an SSL certificate and configure your web server to enable HTTPS. This is crucial for securing data transfer between clients and your server.

9. Set Up Database Backups:
Implement regular backups for your production database to prevent data loss. Schedule automated database backups and store them securely.

10. Monitor and Logging:
Implement monitoring tools to keep an eye on our application's health, performance, and potential issues. Configure logging to record relevant information, making debugging easier.

11. Automate Deployment Process:
Use deployment tools like Fabric, Ansible, or Docker to automate the deployment process. This ensures consistency and reproducibility across different environments.
